<p>My name is Bobby. I&#39;m an&nbsp;Engineer at a makerspace called <a href="http://www.firstbuild.com">FirstBuild</a>&nbsp;in Louisville, KY. I am relatively new to ametuer radio and have been using local UHF and VHF repeaters. I have also started using DMR and have been enjoying it so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I work as an Embedded Software Engineer and have a background in Mechanical Engineering. In my spare time, I enjoy riding my e-bike with my wife and two daughters and flying my drone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a retired school bus that I keep on my family&#39;s farm about 100 miles away from my home. I try to get out to it whenever I am able.</p>
